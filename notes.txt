There can be many problems with the idea I've been working.

There can be one left of a number, and it will be added permanently to the grid. But it can be the last position of the number
with that configuration of the grid, and it can be incorrect. And as it is incorrect, finally the solution will never appear because it is needed to
gete rid of that number at that cell. Maybe the path is allign to a correct thought, but it may be a little more tricky.
