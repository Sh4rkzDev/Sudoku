# Sudoku

Sudoku solver made in Go

To use it, you must have Go installed on your computer.

Once you have everything locally, you have to run the following commands in the console:

```
go mod tity
go build -o SudokuSolver
./SudokuSolver < test.txt
```

It will display the results and the time it takes. You can modify the test.txt file as you want, respecting the format for the input. In case you don't want to use the file as stdin, you will have to put the numbers in the console line by line, respecting again the format. It shows an example of how it should be.
